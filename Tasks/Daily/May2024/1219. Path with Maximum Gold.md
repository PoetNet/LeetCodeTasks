# Intuition

The intuition behind this solution remains the same: to explore all possible paths starting from each cell with gold and keeping track of the maximum gold collected.

# Approach

1. Iterate through each cell with gold.
2. For each such cell, perform depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible paths while keeping track of the maximum gold collected.
3. During DFS, explore adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and recursively continue the exploration.
4. Mark visited cells and backtrack when necessary.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

• Let m be the number of rows and n be the number of columns in the grid.  
• Since there are at most 25 cells containing gold, the worst-case time complexity is O(4^k) , where k is the number of cells with gold.  
• However, since the grid dimensions are bounded by 15 x 15 , the maximum value of k is 225 , which results in a feasible time complexity.

- Space complexity:

• The space complexity is O(m x n) due to the recursive DFS call stack and the auxiliary space used for marking visited cells.  
• Similar to the time complexity, the grid dimensions are bounded by 15 x 15 , resulting in a reasonable space complexity.

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int GetMaximumGold(int[][] grid) {
        int maxGold = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.Length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].Length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != 0) {
                    maxGold = Math.Max(maxGold, DFS(grid, i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxGold;
    }
    private int DFS(int[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.Length || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].Length || grid[i][j] == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int currentGold = grid[i][j];
        grid[i][j] = 0; // Mark as visited
        
        int maxGold = 0;
        
        maxGold = Math.Max(maxGold, currentGold + DFS(grid, i + 1, j));
        maxGold = Math.Max(maxGold, currentGold + DFS(grid, i - 1, j));
        maxGold = Math.Max(maxGold, currentGold + DFS(grid, i, j + 1));
        maxGold = Math.Max(maxGold, currentGold + DFS(grid, i, j - 1));
        
        grid[i][j] = currentGold; // Backtrack
        
        return maxGold;
    }
