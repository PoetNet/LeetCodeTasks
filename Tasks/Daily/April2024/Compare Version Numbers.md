# Intuition

The intuition behind this C# solution is to iterate through the characters of both version strings simultaneously, parsing and comparing each revision directly without splitting the strings beforehand. It leverages two pointers to track the current position in each version string and calculates the integer value of each revision on the fly.

# Approach

1. Initialize two pointers, one for each version string.
2. Iterate through the characters of both version strings simultaneously.
3. Parse each revision by accumulating digits until encountering a dot or reaching the end of the string.
4. Compare the parsed integer values of revisions.
5. If a version number has fewer revisions, treat the missing revisions as 0.
6. Return the comparison result.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

Let m be the length of version1 and n be the length of version2. The while loop iterates through both strings once, parsing and comparing each revision, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(m+n).

- Space complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for variables regardless of the input size.
