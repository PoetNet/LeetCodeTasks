# Array/String

### 1. [Merge Strings Alternately](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/)

#Easy
You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return _the merged string._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
**Output:** "apbqcr"
**Explanation:** The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
**Output:** "apbqrs"
**Explanation:** Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

**Example 3:**

**Input:** word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
**Output:** "apbqcd"
**Explanation:** Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

# 2. [[Greatest Common Divisor of Strings|Greatest Common Divisor of Strings]]

#Medium

For two strings `s` and `t`, we say "`t` divides `s`" if and only if `s = t + t + t + ... + t + t` (i.e., `t` is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return _the largest string_ `x` _such that_ `x` _divides both_ `str1` _and_ `str2`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
**Output:** "ABC"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
**Output:** "AB"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
**Output:** ""

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
- `str1` and `str2` consist of English uppercase letters.

# 3. [[Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies]]

#Easy

There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`, where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the `ith` kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return _a boolean array_ `result` _of length_ `n`_, where_ `result[i]` _is_ `true` _if, after giving the_ `ith` _kid all the_ `extraCandies`_, they will have the **greatest** number of candies among all the kids__, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

Note that **multiple** kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
**Output:** [true,true,true,false,true] 
**Explanation:** If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
**Output:** [true,false,false,false,false] 
**Explanation:** There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
**Output:** [true,false,true]

**Constraints:**

- `n == candies.length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`

# 4. [[Can Place Flowers]]

#Easy

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` _if_ `n` _new flowers can be planted in the_ `flowerbed` _without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
- `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`
